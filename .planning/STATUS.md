## History

### 2026-09-19

- Governance baseline initialised.
- Phase 01 design approved at `phases/01-runtime-shells-workspace/DESIGN.md`.
- No implementation tasks executed. No plan created. No evidence recorded.
- Phase 01 `PLAN.md` drafted using the writing-plans skill at
  `phases/01-runtime-shells-workspace/PLAN.md` (28 tasks; T01–T28). Plan is
  awaiting operator approval. No production code, worktree, branch, dependency
  install, or evidence directory was created. No commit was made.
- Operator approved the four planning interpretations: (1) closed typed
  `MESSAGE_TYPE_ALLOWED_SOURCES` registry validated at every runtime boundary;
  (2) `instanceId`/`writerType` on `WorkspaceRehydrateRequestPayload` and
  `createWorkspaceCoordinator` as the Phase 01 orchestration boundary;
  (3) single closed mutation kind `workspace.metadata.set`; (4) separate
  `unit`/`manifest`/`isolation` Vitest projects with the approved aggregate
  order. Phase 01 `PLAN.md` is approved as authoritative and the interpretations
  are recorded in `PLAN.md`. No commit was made; no implementation started.
- Phase 01 approved-plan commit recorded as `approvedPlanningBaselineCommit` =
  `bd6ac44d6f562722c18f0d07e6910634e549c713` (`docs(phase-01): approve runtime
  implementation plan`), which contains the approved `DESIGN.md` and `PLAN.md`.
  Implementation branch `phase/01-phoenix`; implementation not started; next task
  T01. No production code, worktree, branch, dependency install, or evidence was
  created. No commit was made.
